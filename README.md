## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate system for counting people in crowded environments using advanced AI and ML techniques. The YOLO v8 algorithm, known for its speed and accuracy in object detection, is utilized to detect individuals in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Crowd Counting**: Detects and counts people in real-time using video input.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes YOLO v8 for precise object detection and counting.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle different types of crowded scenes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthikkarthi-Ghost/crowd_Counting_Using-AIML-and-CNN-YOLO_V8.git
   cd Crowd_Counting_Using-AIML-and-CNN-YOLO_V8
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Follow the instructions in the [Dataset](#dataset) section to download and prepare the dataset.

4. **Train the Model**
   Train the model using the provided training scripts:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the Crowd Counting system, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the System**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. Use the interface to start the crowd counting process.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled images of crowded scenes. You can download the dataset from [this link](#) and extract it into the `data` directory.

## Model

The model is built using the YOLO v8 algorithm, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and real-time object detection capabilities. This ensures high accuracy and speed in counting individuals in various scenes.
